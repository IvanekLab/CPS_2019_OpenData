**Study: Using in silico models for design and optimization of science-based Listeria environmental monitoring programs in fresh-cut produce facilities (under peer review)**

In this study, two agent-based models of fresh-cut produce facilities were developed as a way to simulate dynamics of Listeria in the built environment by modeling the different surfaces of equipment and employees in a facility as agents. The components of the model developed in NetLogo and R codes used to analyze the model outputs can be found in the following folders:

-ClusterAnalysis (files from cluster analysis of model predictions)

-NetLogo_A (files used to build an agent-based model of facility A in Netlogo)

-NetLogo_B (files used to build an agent-based model of facility B in Netlogo)

-ScenarioAnalysis (files from scenario analysis of the agent-based models) 

-SimulationSensitivityAnalysis (files from sensitivity analysis of the agent-based models)

*Note: The agent list and cluster analysis input files have been modified to remove individual equipment descriptions (i.e., all non-employee agents are labeled as "equipment") to protect the confidentiality of participating food facilities.*
